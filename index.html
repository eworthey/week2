      About Me
    </h1>
    <div width="50%">
      <p style="font-size: 20pt; padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px">
        I am a neurodivergent wife and mother of two living in a small town in
        Kansas. I am a proud member of the Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma, as are my
        children, although you wouldn't know it by their red hair! My son Cooper
        just turned 5 a few days ago, and my son Tommy is 3. As you can tell,
        this photo is about 2 years old. My husband is in school to become an
        LPC '(Licensed Professional Counselor)', so we are obviously pretty
        busy. Being a wife and a mom of two little boys is certainly a lot of
        work, but it's an absolute blast.
